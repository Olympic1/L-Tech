		KerbinInSpace = Picked up a heavily encrypted broadcast, lets not talk about this.
		KerbinInSpace = A second space center tracking signal is picked up.
		KerbinInSpace = Somebody forgot to turn on the sensor during this test.
		
		DunaSrfLanded = Local radio waves contain a slight pattern. Fascinating!
		DunaSrfLanded = The receiver is going haywire. May need retuning.
		DunaInSpace = Sensors indicate there is a weak radio transmission nearby.
		DunaInSpace = There is a unusually large amount of static picked up.
		
		JoolInSpace = Received short and powerful bursts, sounds like a flag in the wind.
		JoolInSpace = Picked up long bursts, the sound is reminiscent of waves crashing on the seashore near KSC.

		BopSrfLanded = The sensor is giving odd readings here.
		BopInSpace = Received radio waves appear to be scrambled and twisted up.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = The counter returns a simple radiation reading.
		
		SunFlyingLow = The meter goes off the chart as it's bathed in solar radiation!
		SunFlyingLow = The extreme heat and radiation from the star overwhelm the meter.
		SunInSpaceHigh = the sensor detects a decent amount of radiation emanating from the sun.

		MohoSrfLanded = It seems the surface is bathed in solar radiation at this range.
		MohoInSpace = It's hard to tell if there's any radiation coming from the planet- the background solar radiation at this range makes readings difficult.
		
		EveSrfLanded = Surprisingly, it seems Eve's dense atmosphere somehow manages to shield the planet from even more radiation than Kerbin's. There's very low levels here.
		EveInSpace = Aside from the regular solar radiation, there's nothing unusual to report.
		
		GillySrfLanded = The surface of this tiny asteroid displays no radioactive properties.
		GillyInSpace = Solar radiation seems to be the only radiation here.
		
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = Down here with a full atmosphere and magnetosphere the sensor only picks up background radiation... and the odd tiny spike.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Down here with a full atmosphere and magnetosphere the sensor only picks up background radiation... and the odd tiny spike.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Down here with a full atmosphere and magnetosphere the sensor only picks up background radiation.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Down here with a full atmosphere and magnetosphere the sensor only picks up background radiation.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The sensor detects the faintest hint of stronger-than-background radiation.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Down here with a full atmosphere and magnetosphere the sensor only picks up background radiation.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = The sensor barely even picks up background radiation here. 
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The sensor barely even picks up background radiation here. 
		KeringFlyingLowWater = The sensor barely even picks up background radiation here. 
		KerbinInSpace = Outside of Kerbin's atmosphere and magnetosphere, the sensor detects strong solar radiation.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Just inside Kerbin's Magnetosphere, the sensor begins to detect radiation from an external source.
		
		MunSrfLanded = Nothing more than expected background radiation can be detected here.
		MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = The ground here shows nothing more than regular background radiation.
		MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = The terrain has almost no radioactive signature here.
		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = The ground here shows nothing more than regular background radiation, with a few tiny examples. Scientists back home would be interested in this.
		MunSrfLandedHighlands =  The terrain here shows nothing more than regular background radiation.
		MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Nothing more than expected background radiation can be detected here.
		MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = The terrain inside the impact crater has a very faint radioactive signature. Possibly whatever caused the impact had radioactive elements.
		MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = The area has a slightly higher radioactive signature than was expected.
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = Nothing more than expected background radiation can be detected here.
		MunInSpace = The sensor detects normal solar radiation, nothing more.
		
		MinmusSrfLanded = It seems the surface contains almost no radioactive materials.
		MinmusInSpace = The sensor detects normal solar background radiation.
		
		DunaSrfLanded = The surface shows faint traces of radioactivity, a little higher than was expected.
		DunaInSpace = Aside from the regular solar radiation, there's nothing unusual to report.

		IkeSrfLanded = Radiation from an unknown source shows there's definitely something here. 
		IkeInSpace =  There is a faint radioactive signature coming from the surface!
		
		DresSrfLanded = The sensor only detects faint solar radiation.
		DresInSpace = The sensor only detects faint solar radiation.
		
		JoolInSpace = The planet seems to be reflecting the solar radiation, and possibly generating radiation of its own. Curious.
		
		LaytheSrfLanded = The surface is remarkably protected from radiation - there's virtually nothing to detect.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The water shows no signs of radiation.
		LaytheInSpace = Aside from the solar radiation, there is little to report.
		
		VallSrfLanded = There's a slight radioactive signature somewhere on this planet that interferes with the sample.
		VallInSpace = There's a strange hint of radiation coming from the planet.
		
		TyloSrfLanded = The surface contains very little in the way of radioactivity.
		TyloInSpace = Aside from background radiation, there's nothing unusual to report here.
		
		BopSrfLanded = Aside from a faint hint of trace elements, there's almost no radiation here.
		BopInSpace = Aside from background radiation, there's nothing unusual to report here.
